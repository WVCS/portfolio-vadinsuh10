  <p> Jordan Terell Carter was born in Atlanta, Georgia on September 13th, 1996. He attended North Springs Charter High school in Sandy Springs. He often skipped school regulary to work on his music or work at his job at H&M. Carti shopped in thrift stores in his youth, something that has had an effect on his fashion and music style.
    
  <p> Carti began rapping at an early age under the name Sir Cartier. He adopted the name Playboi Carti in 2012 and signed to rapper Father's underground label Awful Records. He began to attract attention in 2015 with his singles "Broke Boi" and "Fetti" featuring Da$h and Maxo Kream, both of which were published to SoundCloud.
    
  <p> Carti released his debut album titled "Playboi Carti" in April of 2017 and reached number 12 on the Billboard 200. This release gained much attraction from various multiple music publications such as XXL, Pitchfork, and PopMatters. This album included 2 succesful:"Magnolia" which placed number 29 on Billboard Hot 100 and "wokeuplikethis*" which placed number 76. On May 11, 2018 Carti dropped his second album titled "Die Lit". His upcoming project "Whole Lotta Red" is expected in 2019. 
    
    <p> Carti's unique musical style is what helped distinguish himself from other rappers. He has been described as a "mumble rapper" and his music as "playful, hard-hitting and melodic". Carti is known for his "Baby Voice Carti" technique, characterized by his voice hitting high pitches with unclear pronunciations and frantic cadences. 
      
    <p> Some notable achievments Carti's accomplished include being one of the ten XXL freshmen in 2017. Not only is Carti a musical genius, he also has modeled a bit for Louis Vuitton, Kanye West, Drake, VFiles, and more. His style and fashion have lead GQ Magazine to define Carti as the "leader of a youth style". Carti's favorite brands include Raf Simons and Balmain and he considers rappers Kanye West and ASAP Rocky as fashion inspirations.
